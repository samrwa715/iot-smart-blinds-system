# ☀️ Smart Blinds IoT Monitoring System

This project is an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to monitor IoT sensor
data related to light intensity and temperature. The system helps in controlling
smart blinds automatically to improve comfort and energy efficiency.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains IoT sensor readings with the following attributes:

Timestamp – date and time of measurement

Temperature (°C) – ambient temperature

Light Intensity (Lux) – measured light level

Blind Status – current state of the blinds (Open / Closed)


## ✅ Results
The dashboard provides:
- Real-time KPI indicators
- Interactive time-series plots
- Data filtering by date
- Clear visualization of blind status
